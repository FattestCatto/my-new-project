First draft of the shadow game: 

Movement:
	-Moving around anywhere on the foreground or background as long as there is darkness/shadows
Main gameplay loop:
	-Grab people or animals to sustain life force and abilities.
	-Burn in the light and take damage
	-Be able to crawl in vents for more stealth.

Abilities:
	-Hide in the shadows and become practically invisible as long as you stay in them.
	-Grab people/animals from a distance with a tentacle-like appendage.
	-The ability to brutalize people and scare others.
	-Control the bodies of dead(or alive) humans to deceive others and pass through checkpoints.
	-Control the bodies of animals to sneak in vents or hard to access areas.
	-Grab things from the environment to throw at light sources and people(?)
 
Acts(?):
	-Act I/tutorial is set around medieval times (or a similar type of scenario) . Enemies are humans with torches in the beginning, later getting crossbows with fire arrows(?). After reaching the end of act I you face off against a group of wizards where you struggle to defeat them (possibly making the player too weak for them) after which they seal you for many years underground.
	-Act II (or the preview of it) is set in a futuristic, cyberpunk like time. Early in the act people only have flashlights and maybe handguns. Over time though enemies gain advanced guns, flashlights and other items to fend you off better.

Goal of the story:
	-Snuff out all light on the planet and reach your perfect form(multiple endings?)
